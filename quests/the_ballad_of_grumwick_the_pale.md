# The Ballad of Grumwick the Pale

## A D&D 5th Edition Adventure for 4-5 Characters of Levels 3-5

---

## Adventure Overview

**The Hook:** A bounty poster offers 75 gold to "silence the singing goat of Beggar's Hill." Savvy adventurers recognize the "gold headband" described as likely a *Headband of Intellect*—worth approximately 10,000 gold pieces. The quest-giver is offering pocket change for a problem that comes with a fortune in magic items.

**The Reality:** What started as a nuisance has metastasized. Grumwick the Pale—an albino goat who found a magic headband and achieved sapience—has been singing songs of beautiful despair for four months. His message: *everything you're working toward will fail, everyone you love will disappoint you, and the only honest response is to stop pretending otherwise.*

A lot of people find this compelling.

What began as travelers stopping to listen became a commune. The commune became a cult. The cult began *recruiting*—and they don't take no for an answer. Missing persons. Bandits on the roads. Families destroyed.

**The Horror:** There is no demon. No curse. No magical compulsion. Grumwick is exactly what he appears to be: an asshole goat who gained the intelligence to express his worldview, and whose worldview resonates with the part of every person that wants to stop trying. The cult members *chose* this. They're choosing it right now.

**The Question:** What do you do about an idea you can't kill?

**Tone:** The Mountain Goats' "No Children" captures the aesthetic—not death-worship, but the seductive comfort of giving up together. The perverse romance of mutual destruction. *"I am drowning, there is no sign of land / You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand."*

## Part One: The Hook

### The Bounty Poster

> **WANTED: SOLUTION TO NOISE COMPLAINT**
>
> Singing goat on Beggar's Hill, east of Millbrook. Extremely annoying. Resisted all relocation attempts.
>
> **REWARD: 75 GOLD PIECES**
>
> Contact Greta Thornwood, Village Elder, Millbrook
>
> *Note: Goat is white. Wears some kind of gold headband. Possibly magical. Just make it stop.*

**The Party's Calculation:** A **DC 12 Arcana** check identifies the headband as likely a *Headband of Intellect*—worth a fortune to the right buyer. Let them feel clever. Let them plan how to spend the money.

---

## Part Two: The Road Darkens

### Day Two: The Missing

The party begins noticing missing persons posters:

> MISSING: Davey Hollowell, 17. Last seen heading toward Beggar's Hill. 20 gold reward.

> MISSING: Eliza Brightwater, 19. Traveling to scribe apprenticeship. Never arrived. 30 gold reward. *Please. She's all I have.*

> MISSING: Silla Vex, merchant. Red hair, blue wagon. Merchant Guild offers 50 gold.

By evening, the party counts **twenty-three** missing persons. All within four months. All in this area. The rewards are getting larger—early posters offer 10-20 gold; recent ones are desperate.

### Day Two Evening: Marta's Rest

**Marta Greaves** runs a small waystation. She speaks in hushed tones:

> "You're heading toward the hill? Turn around. Whatever that bounty's paying, it isn't enough."

**What Marta knows:**
- The singing started four months ago—strange, sad music from the old fort
- Travelers started stopping to listen. Then they stopped leaving.
- Her nephew **Corvin** went to investigate. Came back once, talking about "finally understanding," then left again
- Three weeks ago, people stopped just *staying*—they started being *taken*
- "It's not magic. I asked a hedge witch. Those people are choosing this. That's what scares me."

### Day Three: The Ambush

**Encounter: The Herd's Recruitment Party**

The party is ambushed by **six cult bandits**. Two block the road; four hide in trees (**DC 14 Perception**).

The leader—a hollow-eyed young woman—raises empty hands:

> "Travelers. You look tired. You look like you've been carrying heavy things a long time. There's a place on the hill where none of that matters. Come with us. Rest."

If refused: *"That's what we all said. At first."*

The cultists attack to **incapacitate**, not kill. They fight with unnerving calm—no fear, no anger. They don't retreat when wounded.

**After the Fight:**

Searching bodies reveals a locket matching **Silla Vex's** description. The merchant herself isn't here—but her possessions are on someone who took them from her.

If a cultist is captured:

> "You'll understand eventually. When you're tired enough. When you've lost enough. Then you'll come to the hill."

---

## Part Three: Millbrook

Population formerly 200, now 120. Fields half-harvested. A wedding arch rotting in someone's yard.

### Key NPCs

**Barret and Mina Hollowell** (innkeepers): Their son Davey left two months ago. Mina: *"I'd rather he was dead. At least then I could mourn."*

**Greta Thornwood** (village elder):

> "Seventy-five gold to silence a goat. That's what I posted when this was a noise complaint."
>
> She gestures at empty streets.
>
> "Now half my village is gone. My granddaughter Lily snuck out two weeks ago. Her note said: 'Grumwick says hope is just delayed disappointment, and I'm so tired of being disappointed.'"

**What Greta knows:**
- The goat arrived four months ago, settled in Fort Vane's ruins
- She's tried reasoning (they listened politely), threatening (they shrugged)
- She hired three mercenaries. Two joined the cult. One drank himself to death.

**Greta's Offer:** 75 gold base. 300 if cultists are returned. 500 + village treasury if the threat ends. *"I don't care what you do with the goat. Just end this."*

**Brother Aldous** (priest):

> "Grumwick isn't promising heaven. He's promising *permission*—permission to stop caring, stop trying, stop hoping. For people taught their whole lives that they *must* hope... that permission feels like love."
>
> "The terrifying thing? There's no magic. Those people aren't enchanted. They're *convinced*."

### Optional: The Survivor

**Corvin Greaves** escaped recently. He's hiding in the temple cellar:

> "It's not what you'd think. No robes, no rituals. Just people sitting around, agreeing that nothing matters. There's this... peace."
>
> His hands shake.
>
> "I almost didn't leave. But I saw myself in a bucket of water and didn't recognize..."

**Compound info:** Fort Vane rebuilt with palisades. 40-50 people. Leadership includes Eliza Brightwater (logistics) and Brother Harwick (former paladin, keeps order).

---

## Part Four: The Compound

### Approach Options

- **Main Road:** Watched by sentries. "Friend or supplicant?"
- **Ravine (East):** Three **DC 14 Stealth** checks. Failure alerts 1d4+2 cultists.
- **Collapsed Wall (North):** **DC 16 Athletics** to clear quietly. Leads inside.
- **Performance Times:** Grumwick sings at dawn and dusk. Guards distracted but party must save against songs.

### Layout

**Outer Compound:**
- **Gate:** Four sentries with disadvantage on Perception (vigilance requires caring)
- **Camp:** 15-20 cultists sleeping, staring at clouds, having languid conversations
- **The Pit:** Holding area for those "not ready yet." Contains **Lily Thornwood** (Greta's granddaughter), **Senna** (a captured bard), and **Davey Hollowell** (who may or may not want rescue)

**Inner Compound:**
- **Inner Gate:** Two fanatics, more alert
- **Gathering Ground:** Performance area with raised platform

---

### Cult Fanatic

*Saves* Wis +5, Cha +6 | *Condition Immunities* frightened

***Aura of Acceptance.*** Allies within 10 ft. have advantage on charm/frighten saves.

***Former Paladin.*** Harwick deals nonlethal damage unless a PC has killed a cultist.

**Actions:** Multiattack (two longsword, +6, 1d8+3), Sermon of Surrender (1/day: DC 14 Wis or disadvantage on attacks for 1 minute)

**Roleplaying:**
> "I watched everyone I loved die for a cause that didn't matter. Grumwick didn't save me. He just told me there was nothing to save."

---

**Weakness:** A genuine emotional appeal about her father's suffering forces a DC 14 Wis save. On failure, her Rhetorical Trap is disabled for 24 hours.

---

### Grumwick the Pale

An albino goat who found a *Headband of Intellect* on a dead wizard. Grumwick was already an asshole—a biter, an escape artist. Intelligence gave him *vocabulary*.

**Philosophy:** Not entirely wrong (effort doesn't guarantee success, hope can disappoint, everything decays). His error is the conclusion: that because hope *can* disappoint, it's better not to hope.

**Wants:** Adoration, comfort, to be right, to never lose the headband.

**Fears:** Losing the headband, being alone, being wrong.

---

#### Grumwick the Pale
*Small beast, chaotic neutral*

**AC** 12 | **HP** 44 (8d6+16) | **Speed** 40 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 14 (+2) | 19 (+4) | 12 (+1) | 18 (+4) |

*Saves* Int +7, Cha +7 | *Skills* Performance +9, Persuasion +7
*Languages* Common, Elvish | **CR** 5 (1,800 XP)

***Headband of Intellect.*** If removed, Int drops to 3, loses all special abilities, becomes a normal—but still aggressive—goat. Will attempt to ram and bite whoever took it.

***Sure-Footed.*** Advantage on saves against being knocked prone.

***Cutting Words (5/short rest).*** Reaction: subtract 1d8 from attack, check, or damage roll within 60 ft.

**Actions**

***Ram.*** +4 to hit, 1d4+1 bludgeoning. If moved 20 ft. straight, +1d4 damage and DC 11 Str save or prone.

***Vicious Mockery.*** DC 15 Wis or 2d4 psychic and disadvantage on next attack.

***Dissonant Whispers.*** DC 15 Wis or 3d6 psychic and must flee.

***Song of Surrender (Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature in 60 ft. makes DC 15 Wis save or has disadvantage on attacks and checks for 1 minute (repeat save each turn).

***Drowning Together (1/day).*** Each creature in 120 ft. makes DC 15 Cha save or is *charmed* for 1 hour—won't attack Grumwick or followers, reluctant to leave. Not magical; *Dispel Magic* doesn't work, but *Calm Emotions* or taking damage from a cultist ends it.

## Part Six: Confrontation

### Encountering Grumwick

> The goat is smaller than expected. White as bone, pink-eyed, golden band catching the light. He regards you with amusement and disdain.
>
> "Ah. The rescue party. Barging in to save people who don't want saving, solving problems that will just recur."
>
> He tilts his head.
>
> "Do you ever get tired? Because you look like people carrying something heavy who've forgotten they can put it down."

### Key Dialogue

**"Their families miss them."**
> "And what did those families do? Put expectations on them. Need things from them. Love is just obligation with better marketing."

**"You're just a goat."**
> "Four months ago I was eating and defecating in a purposeless void. Then I put on this headband and understood exactly what existence is: temporary, arbitrary, indifferent. Don't lecture me on the appropriate response."

**"What if you're wrong?"**
> "My followers are happier than they've ever been. Can hope guarantee that?"

**"We're taking you down."**
> "Kill me. The headband ends up on someone else eventually. My followers remember. Some will keep singing my songs. The next exhausted traveler stops to listen..."
>
> "You can't kill an idea. You can only shout louder."

---

## Part Seven: Resolution

### Option 1: Remove the Headband

Get within 5 feet, win **contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand vs. Acrobatics)**, yank.

Grumwick's Intelligence drops to 3 instantly. Mid-word, he stops. Blinks. Then, because he was always a bad goat, he tries to ram whoever's holding his headband, bleating furiously.

**Aftermath:**
- Cult members experience grief, embarrassment, or anger
- The philosophy doesn't disappear—they remember
- The party has a 10,000 gp magic item
- They've also essentially lobotomized someone

### Option 2: Kill Grumwick

44 HP, AC 12. Not hard.

**Challenges:**
- Cultists try to protect him
- Harwick fights lethally if any cultist dies
- Killing an intelligent being who hasn't personally committed violence may haunt certain characters

**Aftermath:**
- Cult collapses; some blame the party, some thank them
- Millbrook is relieved but uncomfortable

### Option 3: Out-Argue Grumwick

Skill challenge: **4 successes before 3 failures**.

- **Persuasion DC 16:** Appeal to meaning or connection
- **Insight DC 14:** Identify his fears (losing the headband, being wrong)
- **Performance DC 16:** Counter-song
- **Intelligence DC 15:** Find the logical flaw (conflating "effort can fail" with "effort is worthless")

**On Success:**

> Grumwick is silent.
>
> "Maybe I've been shouting about the dark because I was afraid to walk back into the light and be disappointed again."
>
> He looks at his followers.
>
> "I don't know anything anymore. That's... not as comforting as I thought."

He leaves to "think about things." The spell breaks.

### Option 4: Give Him Something Better

Grumwick craves an audience. **Persuasion DC 18** or a creative offer:
- Traveling philosopher
- Bardic college that appreciates "transgressive aesthetics"
- Write a book instead of hoarding followers

> "Actual academics debating my ideas? That does sound more interesting than watching farmers forget how to plow."

### Option 5: Counter-Programming

- **Senna the Bard** can perform counter-songs (DC 12 Wis for cultists to "wake up")
- **Family Reunions:** Genuine grief grants advantage on saves
- **Feed Them:** Proper meals restore perspective (advantage on Wis saves for 24 hours)
- **Time:** Without Grumwick, philosophy fades. After one week, DC 10 Persuasion works.

## Rewards

**From Millbrook:** 75-500 gp depending on outcome
**From Families:** 100-200 gp total
**From Compound:** ~300 gp in goods, Headband of Intellect (~10,000 gp), Grumwick's Song Journal

### Grumwick's Song Journal
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*

A bard who studies it for 8 hours can add one song:
- **"Nothing Really Matters":** As *Calm Emotions* but targets become apathetic. 1/long rest.
- **"Hand in Unlovable Hand":** As *Suggestion* but suggestion must involve giving something up. 1/long rest.

>
> *We're drowning and there's no sign of land*

## DM Notes

**Core Tension:** Grumwick isn't entirely wrong. His error is the conclusion—that because hope can disappoint, it's better not to hope. The best resolution offers something better, not just proves him wrong.

**On Violence:** The cultists aren't evil. Killing them should feel bad. If the party murders through the compound, the aftermath reflects it.

**On the Headband:** Worth a fortune. But now they know what intelligence without wisdom can create. What will they do with it?
