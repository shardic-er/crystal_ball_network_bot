# Quest Board

The White Tower Banking Company occasionally contracts adventuring work through the Crystal Ball Network. Brave souls can take on dangerous missions for gold and glory - and whatever treasures they recover along the way.

## How Quests Work

1. **Browse Available Quests** - Quests appear below with descriptions, rewards, and turn limits
2. **Accept a Quest** - React to claim a quest for yourself
3. **Assemble Your Party** - Select adventurer NPCs from your contacts to join the expedition
4. **Run the Quest** - A private thread is created where the adventure unfolds turn-by-turn
5. **Reap the Rewards** - Gold, loot, and reputation await successful parties

## Understanding Quests

- **Turn Limit**: Each quest has a maximum number of turns (messages) before it concludes
- **Base Reward**: Guaranteed gold for completing the quest
- **Loot**: Items discovered during the quest are added to your inventory
- **Party Equipment**: Your adventurers bring their attuned items - the right gear can unlock new solutions

## Risks

Adventuring is dangerous. Party members may be downed during quests and require healing gold to recover. Choose your party wisely and equip them well.
