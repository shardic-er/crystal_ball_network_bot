# White Tower Banking - Account Vaults

Welcome to your personal vault managed by the White Tower Banking Company.

## Your Inventory Thread

Each member receives a private vault thread (`inventory-{username}`) where your purchased items are securely stored. This vault is:

- **Persistent** - Your items are safe and never deleted
- **Read-only** - Locked to prevent accidental changes
- **Magically Updated** - Items automatically appear when you purchase them through the Crystal Ball Network
- **Automatically Created** - Your vault is created when you join the server

## Vault Contents

Your inventory thread displays:
- Current gold balance
- Total items owned
- Total collection value
- All purchased items (one per message with full details)

## Managing Your Wealth

Items purchased through #crystal-ball-network are automatically delivered to your vault. The Curator handles all transactions and updates your balance accordingly.
