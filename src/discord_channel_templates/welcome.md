# Welcome to the Crystal Ball Network

A magical item collection game where you browse, purchase, and build a vault of unique D&D items through an interdimensional merchant.

## What is the Crystal Ball Network?

The CBN is White Tower Banking Company's revolutionary magical marketplace. By networking enchanted crystal balls together, they created the realm's first magical telecommunications system - enabling instant browsing and delivery of magic items from across the multiverse.

## How to Play

1. **Check Your Inventory** - You automatically received a personal vault thread (`inventory-{username}`) with **500 gp** when you joined
2. **Visit the Portal** - Go to #crystal-ball-network
3. **Start Shopping** - Simply type what you're looking for (e.g., "magic swords" or "healing potions")
4. **Browse Results** - The Curator will greet you and show matching items in a private thread
5. **Purchase** - Click 🛒 on any item to buy it instantly
6. **Build Your Collection** - Purchased items appear in your inventory vault

## The Curator's Personality

The Curator of Bewildering Networks adjusts their demeanor based on your wealth. This is part of the game's entertainment:

- **10,000+ gp**: Extremely obsequious and fawning
- **1,000-9,999 gp**: Professional and polite
- **100-999 gp**: Condescending about your "modest means"
- **10-99 gp**: Actively rude - calls you broke, tells you to get a job
- **Below 10 gp**: Very rude and dismissive

Don't take it personally - it's all in good fun!

## Actions

- **In #crystal-ball-network** - Type your search query to browse items
- **In search threads** - Click the shopping cart to purchase an item
