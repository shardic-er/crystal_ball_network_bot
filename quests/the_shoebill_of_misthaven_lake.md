## Metadata

- base_reward: 1500

## Description

A giant shoebill - large as a young dragon and nearly as dangerous - has claimed an island in the center of Misthaven Lake. The mist-shrouded waters have become a death trap for fishermen. The village of Shorehollow offers 1500 gold to end the threat, but survivors whisper that the creature's nest glitters with the possessions of its many victims.

### Setting

**Misthaven Lake**: Three miles across, perpetually shrouded in thick mist. A small rocky island sits at its center. The mist reduces visibility to 30 feet at the edges, 5 feet near the island.

**Shorehollow**: A fishing village on the shore. Population down by a third in six months. Desperate.

**The Island**: 200 feet across, rocky shores, scraggly trees. A massive nest of branches and debris sits at the peak. The shores are difficult to land on quietly.

### The Creature

A shoebill of impossible size. Grey feathers, blade-like beak, cold intelligent eyes. It makes no sound - not when it moves, not when it strikes. It hunts in the mist with terrifying patience, sometimes following prey for an hour before attacking.

The shoebill is not evil - it's an apex predator. But it's not very smart. It arranges collected boats deliberately. 

### Key NPCs

**Elder Maren Tidecrest**: Offering the bounty. Lost her son Tobias to the creature.

**Old Pen**: Traumatized survivor. The shoebill let him live. "It was *playing* with us."

### The Nest

Contains bones, coins, jewelry, and equipment from dozens of victims accumulated over months two or three of which might be magical. The glitter visible from the water is real - there's treasure here, if you can reach it.

## Scenes

### The Crossing

The party must cross the lake through thick mist. The shoebill may stalk them, observing before striking. Signs of its presence: ripples with no source, mist pulling in one direction, absolute silence, shapes that vanish when looked at directly.

### The Island

Rocky shores require care to land without alerting the creature. The shoebill may be in the nest, hunting in the mist, or watching from the water's edge.

### The Confrontation

The shoebill fights intelligently - using mist for ambush, retreating when wounded, targeting isolated party members. It can grapple with its beak and swallow medium creatures whole. It will flee if badly wounded rather than die.

## Resolution Conditions

**Success**: Kill the shoebill or drive it off permanently
**Partial**: Recover significant treasure but shoebill survives
**Failure**: Party retreats empty-handed or is defeated

## Loot Table

The nest contains accumulated wealth from months of kills. Award based on what the party actually retrieves:
(2 uncommon, 1 rare items total)
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Coins and jewelry | 200-500 gp worth depending on how thoroughly they search |
| Cloak of the Manta Ray | Half-digested, from a previous adventurer |
| Quality weapon or armor | From a victim - type flexible based on party needs |
| Sentimental items | Lockets, rings - can return to Shorehollow for gratitude/bonus gold |
| Shoebill parts | Feathers, beak - valuable to collectors or craftsmen if harvested |

The narrator should improvise specific items based on what makes sense for the story and what the party's adventurers might find useful.

## DM Notes

This is a straightforward monster hunt with horror atmosphere. The shoebill should feel like a threat before combat - let the party feel watched, find signs of kills, experience the oppressive mist.

No negotiation is possible. The creature is has no interest in communication. This is predator vs prey. If the monster escapes, its nest can be looted but the 1500 gold reward is forfeit.
